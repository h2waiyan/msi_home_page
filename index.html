                Python is powerful... and fast;

                First developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, Python has advanced as an open source programming language by managing public discussion through Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). In 2018, van Rossum stepped down as the language's Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL), and, as officially outlined in PEP 13, a steering council was put in place to serve as the leadership of the language.
